# 📈-ABC-Analysis-in-Power-BI-Power-Query-DAX-
This repository demonstrates an **end‑to‑end**, **real‑world ABC (Pareto) analysis** using **Power BI**, starting from **messy CSV data**, cleaning it with **Power Query (M)**, and building an **advanced DAX-driven analytical model** with dynamic thresholds, field parameters, and executive‑grade visuals.
<br>
The goal of this project is not just to build visuals, but to **teach the reasoning behind every step**, so readers can **learn**, **reuse**, and **extend** the patterns.
## 🧠 Business Problem
Delivery delays are hurting operations. We need to know which Products, Suppliers, or Regions contribute most to the delay so we can prioritize action.
Instead of looking at raw totals, we apply ABC classification (Pareto principle):
  - A → Small number of items causing most of the delay
  - B → Moderate contributors
  - C → Long tail with minimal impact
